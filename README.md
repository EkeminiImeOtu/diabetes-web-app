The dataset used to develop this artificial intelligence model originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
Its purpose is to predict, based on specific diagnostic measurements, whether a patient has diabetes. 
The selection of instances in this dataset was subject to various constraints.
 Notably, all individuals included are females of Pima Indian heritage, aged at least 21 years.


The following features have been provided to help us predict whether a person is diabetic or not:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)

Age: Age (years)

Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

I used this data to check how the models run by inputting the values:

Click on the link above and input the values required to check if the person will be diabetic or not.
NB: add numeric values else you will be asked to input the right values.

Thank you
